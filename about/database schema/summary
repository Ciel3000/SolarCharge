charging_station:

Purpose: Represents a physical charging station.

Key Fields: station_id (Primary Key), station_name, location_description, latitude, longitude, solar_panel_wattage, battery_capacity_kwh, current_battery_level.

Relationships: Referenced by charging_port, charging_session, and station_maintenance.

users:

Purpose: Stores profile information for users of the SolarCharge system. This table is linked directly to Supabase's internal authentication system.

Key Fields: user_id (Primary Key, also a Foreign Key referencing auth.users.id), fname, lname, contact_number, is_admin.

Relationships: References auth.users (Supabase's built-in authentication table). Referenced by admin_profiles, user_subscription, payment, daily_energy_usage, charging_session, and notification.

admin_profiles:
