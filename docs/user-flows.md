## Error Handling Flows

### Payment Failure

1. **Payment processing fails**
   - System attempts retry
   - User is notified of failure
   - Alternative payment methods suggested

2. **Session handling**
   - Charging continues if already started
   - User must resolve payment before next session

### Station Malfunction

1. **Station detects error**
   - Station enters safe mode
   - Active sessions are safely terminated
   - Users are notified immediately

2. **Operator response**
   - Operator is alerted
   - Station is marked as offline
   - Maintenance is scheduled

### Network Connectivity Issues

1. **ESP32 loses connection**
   - Firmware continues local operation
   - Data is cached locally
   - Connection is re-established when possible

2. **Data synchronization**
   - Cached data is sent when connection restored
   - System integrity is maintained

## Security Flows

### User Authentication

1. **Login process**
   - User provides credentials
   - System validates and issues JWT token
   - Token is used for subsequent requests

2. **Session management**
   - Tokens expire after set time
   - Users must re-authenticate
   - Failed attempts are logged

### Data Protection

1. **Data encryption**
   - All sensitive data is encrypted
   - HTTPS for all communications
